- 👋 Hi, I’m @expnem, better known as Raziel!
- 👀 I’m interested in web archival, sparkledogs, and anything that happens to go 'beep'.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (or at least stumbling my way through) basic HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely nothing. I can hardly work with myself, let alone another person. XD
- 📫 How to reach me: my Discord is scardonia.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her or they/them! Whichever you're feelin' most like. Doesn't matter much to me. :P
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started webmastering on Neocities before porting my site over to here!
